Call me Phil, I'm a software developer from Montreal, Quebec.

You'll find me professionally writing enterprise code w/ NodeJS and Python. I also dabble with DevOps/Infra and have fun with digital hoarding and networking on the weekends.

I work at a fantastic digital-solutions agency called [OSEDEA](https://www.osedea.com/), look us up if you need a strong software/design team.
