Call me Phil, I'm from Montreal, Quebec.

I _try_ to make complicated stuff complex and complex stuff simple. The simple stuff I'm not too worried about.

I work at a fantastic software development and innovation agency called **[OSEDEA](https://www.osedea.com/)**, look us up if you need a strong battle-tested dev team.
