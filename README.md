Call me Phil, I'm a software developer from Montreal, Quebec.

You'll find me professionally writing enterprise code w/ NodeJS & Python and dabbling with DevOps/Infra (ECS/Fargate, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible). I have fun with digital hoarding and networking on the weekends. If I'm writing code it's build, shipped and running on Docker.

I work at a fantastic digital-solutions agency called [OSEDEA](https://www.osedea.com/), look us up if you need a strong software/design team.
